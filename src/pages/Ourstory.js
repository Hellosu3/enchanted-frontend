          Sue and Tiago met online as one's coffee and another's bagel. After a series of lame and disappointing dates, Sue decided to brave her chance and lower her age range, from older to a bit younger; out of her comfort zone. Meanwhile the clock struck midnight and the timing was impeccable. It was Tiago's birthday. He had barely made the cut of Sue's revised age range, making him a potential match. How serendipitous! In a matter of minutes, she noticed a message from someone with a unique name and blurred photos. Sue took a leap of faith and a chance on love and responded to his "hey!" The rest was history.
