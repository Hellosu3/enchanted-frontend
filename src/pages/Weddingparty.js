//     bio: "Grace is one of my bestest friends, I've known her since jr. high.  She has such a grand presence wherever she goes. She has such a deep love for humanity. It draws so many to her, and friends seek her counsel because she's warm and gives solid advice, which is one of many reasons why God called her into therapy. Aside from her professional life, she is so fun! We always stood up for one another, burned one another cds, held each other accountible, partied together, went to church together, stuck by one another through the good times and the bad, always praying for one another, in one another's bridal party, and I'm excited to raise my future kids with your kids. We went through so many seasons together, but one of my most memorable memories was when, a guy at a party was showing me his tattoo so he took off his shirt to show it off, she came charging out of nowhere and told him to put his shirt back on and that I didnt need to see any of that. She is very protective and loves fiercely. I'm so grateful we went from teens to adults together. Sharing so much of our lives together. How did I get so lucky? You're somone who makes me feel seen and loved. I love you"

She motivates me each and everyday to become a better version of myself. She is my constant cheerleader and I am hers. I first met her my freshman year. I used to think she was always glaring at me, then one day she offered her mom to give me a ride to school. She was and is still so sweet. We then had all the same classes throughout the years. I used to copy her homework and get good grades. I am forever grateful she never snitched on me. She is one of the smartest girls I know who has the strongest grit ever. She is the epitome of work hard and play hard. I admire that she is always aspiring to be zen and loving in every aspect. She attracts so many to her. Everyone and myself adores her bright personality. I am very lucky to have you! I love you. "

//     bio: "Anne is another bestie of mine. I call our friendship a divine one. We've known one another for several years, but feels like a lifetime, and since the beginning we just clicked and instantly she became my person. I can share my deepest thoughts and she will help me process wihtout judgement. She's an answer to prayer, a godly sister, I have so much fun doing life with. She is an intelligent woman, a respectable teacher, an amazing friend, and mother. She is a total empath and can relate to so many. She attracts a lot of people and friends. She is really inclusive and brings people together. She builds bridges for different community groups to come together. She is extremely loving and just absolutely beautiful inside and out. For those that didn't know, Anne and I partnered together and freelanced makeup together, we became an amazing team. Seriously I got really lucky to have met you and do life with you! I hope to have kids soon so we can raise our babies together. I love you!"

//     description: 'Bridesmaid',
//     bio: "I love this woman so so much. Amy is one of my dearest and closest friends. She has the sweetest soul. She radiates joy, even when things can get tough. Even when she's sick and in pain I have to get it out of her if she's in pain. She will not complain to you. She puts others before herself and makes sure everyone is taken care of. I am so proud of her for all that she has accomplished. She wants to go back to school while working full time and is a full time super mom. I admire her tenacity and strength. She has always been the motherly type since we were young. She would make sure we drank enough water when we were drinking, and try and deesclate drama at parties. If ever I need advice or just feeling stressed out, she would give me so much love and encouragement. She is also the friend who knows all the cute hallmark type quotes that are gives you the warm and fuzzies.  It's funny because we met Amy through her ex boyfriend. Our large group of friends took an astronmy course in college and all failed/ dropped out. We lost touch with him/ didn't care, but kept Amy. It was fate we met them so I could meet you. I am so lucky I met you! "

//     description: 'Bridesmaid',
//     bio: "I first met Rachel at Anne's birthday lunch. We sat next to one another and clicked. We got to talk more when we made our first coffee run together after lunch, which ended up being the first to many more. We started hanging out every weekend and went on more of our fun brunch/coffee dates. She is someone I consider a SOUL sister and one of my dearest friends. I can fully be myself and she loves me for who I am. You speak my love languages. She is my ride or die and is always down for me. I can call her at random hours of the day and will answer. If I am having a crappy day, she reminds me she is a phone call away and will be there for me. She not only says she loves me, but shows it through action. One of my core memories of Rachel is when we laughed so hard and she spit out matcha on my dog staining her coat green! It was hilarious. We have so many funny moments, but by far that is forever imprinted. You're truly a delight. You bring myslef and others so much joy. You're the most intelligent, lover, all about second chances and forgiveness, positive, empathetic, and the list goes on and on. I love you and am so blessed to have you on my team.   "

//     description: 'Bridesmaid',
//     bio: "Leah is my sweet childhood bestie I grew up with. She reminds me of home. Someone safe and comforting. We used to tell our parents we were studying and went to the library to have a full on boisterous picnic with our mojo potatoes. We would write love letters to one another in colorful gel pens then get the giggles like we were high, but was high off the sugar from shasta sodas, and was kicked out of the library for the day. Another core memory I'll never forget was the time she broke her leg the day of the school carnival. Her dad thought she was faking it and made her hobble around campus. If that wasn't bad enough, a guy she had friend zoned asked her out in front of us. She said no, and he ran off crying. Out of nowhere it started pouring rain and thunder. We had to help carry Leah to the gym, as we were drenched and she was limping. I could write a book of all the events that took place together. My adolescent and prepubescent years were so bright and colorful because you were in it. It helped shape me to be the woman I am today. We did daring things together, I can't ever imagine doing now, but you remained constant and as we transitioned to adulthood, you're the same beauitful, smart, and charming woman in a much mature way of course. I love that we could recount all our fond memories and create new memories together! love you 4 eva."

My baby sister, you will forever be my limtied 2 wearing little 10 year old sister. You are so generous and care deeply. God blessed me with a built in blood best friend I get to call sister.We have so much fun together, and living at home has been the best and challenging experience together.

You're extremely gifted with wisdom, I mean your name means wise woman. You live out your name well. Many who don't even know you well, will ask you for advice.
